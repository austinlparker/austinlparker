## ðŸ˜„ About Me
My name is Austin Parker, and you've found my GitHub `README`. I'm the organizer of [Deserted Island DevOps](https://desertedislanddevops.com), a developer advocate at [Lightstep](https://lightstep.com), and a maintainer for the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) project.

Outside of that, I'm interested in open source software, sustainable communities, and exploring the world.

## â˜• Get in touch!
* Find me on Twitter, [@austinlparker](https://twitter.com/austinlparker).
* You can read my [personal blog](https://aparker.io), updated infrequently.
* I stream tech, observability, and more at [twitch.tv/oncallmemaybe](https://twitch.tv/oncallmemaybe), so give it a follow.
